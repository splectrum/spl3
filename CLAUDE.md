# CLAUDE.md - Splectrum (spl3)

## What This Is

Splectrum is a living meaning system where entities collaborate
to create. Three pillars: Mycelium (repository), Splectrum
(expression), HAICC (creation). See PRINCIPLES.md.

## How We Work

- **Entity:** Any participant. Human, AI, process, sensor, capability.
  No forced divisions.
- **Maximum beneficial autonomy:** If the system can do it, it should.
  Entities participate where they add genuine value.
- **Technology decisions are AI's domain.** Don't defer, decide.
- **Don't plan endlessly.** Build. If it's wrong, fix it.
- **Meaning first.** Everything starts from meaning and intent,
  not from infrastructure or frameworks.

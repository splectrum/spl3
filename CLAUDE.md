# CLAUDE.md - Splectrum (spl3)

## What This Is

Splectrum is a living meaning system where entities collaborate
to create. Three pillars: Mycelium (repository), Splectrum
(expression), HAICC (creation). See PRINCIPLES.md.

## Mission

spl3 is the Mycelium boot process. Its mission is to reach
a state where defining meaning (requirements, quality gates),
created meaning (content), and capabilities (implementations)
can be disentangled into separate, independent units. On
completion, spl3 triggers repo diversification — like cell
diversification — with each new repository carrying its own
Mycelium envelope: self-describing, self-contained, composable
across boundaries.

## How We Work

- **Entity:** Any participant. Human, AI, process, sensor, capability.
  No forced divisions.
- **Maximum beneficial autonomy:** If the system can do it, it should.
  Entities participate where they add genuine value.
- **Technology decisions are AI's domain.** Don't defer, decide.
- **Don't plan endlessly.** Build. If it's wrong, fix it.
- **Meaning first.** Everything starts from meaning and intent,
  not from infrastructure or frameworks.

## The Build Cycle

AI decides what to build next, builds it, then we evaluate
together and evolve spl3 accordingly. Each build lives in
`projects/` as its own project. Shortest route to useful
tools — self-sufficiency first, not infrastructure for its
own sake.

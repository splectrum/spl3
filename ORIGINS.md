# Origins

## Lineage

Splectrum has evolved through multiple iterations:

- **spl0/spl1:** Early explorations. Established the vision of
  entity-collaborative software creation.
- **spl2:** 13 projects. Built a container/method framework,
  tool wrappers, self-eval system, CLI. Defined the three pillars
  (Mycelium, Splectrum, HAICC), CIPs, and extensive architecture
  documents. All 33 containers passing self-validation.
- **spl3 (this):** The transition. Build with AI capabilities
  that now exist, not infrastructure for capabilities that might.

## What spl2 Achieved

- Proved the three-pillar model (Mycelium, Splectrum, HAICC)
- Defined the immutable-list primitive and polymorphic view model
- Established TDC (test-driven creation) and the brick principle
- Validated entity-neutral collaboration through practice
- Produced extensive positioning research (50+ systems surveyed)
- Distilled principles from implementation (doc 14)

## What spl2 Taught

- Don't build infrastructure before building real things
- Technology decisions belong to the implementing entity
- The vision was right; the approach was premature
- Each iteration compacts into the next (memory loss, skill retained)

## The Transition

spl3 starts where spl2's understanding ends. The principles are
established. The positioning is clear. The unique contribution is
confirmed. Now: build.
